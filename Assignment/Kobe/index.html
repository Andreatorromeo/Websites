            <article>
                <p>Bryant was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of three children and only son of former NBA player Joe
                    Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. He was also the maternal nephew of basketball player John "Chubby"
                    Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant
                    menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean". Bryant's family was
                    Catholic and he had always practiced his faith. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA
                    and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball at a lower level.
                    After two years they moved first to Reggio Calabria and then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe
                    became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond
                    of Reggio Emilia, which he considered a loving place and where his best childhood memories were
                    made.
                    Bryant started playing basketball when he was aged three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when
                    he was growing up. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study. At
                    an early age, Bryant also learned to play soccer and his favorite team was A.C. Milan. While living
                    in Reggio Emilia he began to play basketball in earnest.
                    During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league.

                <h3>1996 Draft</h3>
                <p>
                    Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former
                    Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry West,
                    "marched over these people".[39]
                    The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights to
                    free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O'Neal. Bill Branch, the
                    Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their draft selection at #13
                    to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered
                    drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the
                    pick was made. Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the
                    trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles.
                    However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when
                    the league's off-season moratorium ended. Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to
                    cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the
                    season began. Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5 million

                <h3>1999-2002</h3>
                <p>
                    Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the 1999–2000 season due to a hand injury
                    that he had incurred during a preseason game against the Washington Wizards. When Bryant was back
                    and playing over 38 minutes a game, he had an increase in all statistical categories during the
                    1999–2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of
                    O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most
                    in NBA history. This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA Team
                    Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player to
                    receive defensive honors).[66] While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had
                    some clutch performances including a 25-point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in game 7 of the
                    Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers. He also threw an alley-oop pass to
                    O'Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the 2000 Finals, against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant
                    injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' Jalen Rose's foot.
                    Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally.[68][69] Bryant did not return to
                    the game, and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4, Bryant scored 22 points in the
                    second half and led the team to an OT victory as O'Neal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the
                    winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120–118.[70] With a 116–111 Game 6 victory, the Lakers won
                    their first championship since 1988.[71]
                    Statistically, the 2000–01 season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, but he averaged
                    six more points per game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O'Neal
                    began to surface. Once again, Bryant led the team in assists, with five per game. The Lakers,
                    however, only won 56 games, an 11-game dropoff from the previous year. The Lakers would respond by
                    going 15–1 in the playoffs. They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. In the
                    semifinals round, the Lakers swept the Sacramento Kings. In Game 4 against the Kings, Bryant
                    recorded 48 points, 16 rebounds and 3 assists in a 119–113 series-clinching win.[73] They swept the
                    San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals to advance to the Finals, before losing their first game
                    against the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime. They would go on to win the next four games and bring
                    their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played
                    heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In
                    the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league.[31] Bryant ended up
                    making the All NBA Second team and All NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition,
                    he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the third year in a row (no game in 1999).
                    In the 2001–02 season, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. <strong>On January
                        14, 2002, Bryant recorded a then career-high 56 points</strong> to go along with five rebounds
                    and four assists in a 120–81 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies.[74] He continued his all-round
                    play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also had a career-high
                    46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy
                    after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout
                    the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers
                    were "going to cut your hearts out".[75][76] While making the All-NBA Defensive team again, Bryant
                    was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games
                    that year and finished second in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings. Bryant
                    was suspended one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers' March
                    1, 2002 victory over the Pacers.[77][78]
                    The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the
                    previous year. While the Lakers swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4–1 in the first two rounds
                    of the playoffs, the Lakers did not have home-court advantage against the Sacramento Kings. The
                    series would stretch to seven games, the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000
                    Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make
                    their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the 2002 Finals, against the New Jersey Nets,
                    Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included
                    scoring a quarter of the team's points.[79] At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win
                    three championships.[79] Bryant's play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth
                    quarter of games, specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs. This cemented Bryant's
                    reputation as a "clutch player".

                <h3>2002-2007</h3>
                <p>
                    In the first game of the 2002–03 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4
                    steals in an 87–82 loss to the visiting Spurs.[81] On November 1, Bryant recorded a triple-double of
                    33 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists in a 108–93 win over the LA Clippers. He also set an NBA
                    record for three-pointers in a game on January 7, 2003, when he made 12 against the Seattle
                    SuperSonics.[83] Bryant averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or
                    more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In
                    addition, he averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career-highs to that
                    point.[11] Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive first teams,[11] and
                    came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the
                    Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals in six games to the
                    eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs.[84]

                    In the following season, the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars Karl Malone, and Gary Payton
                    to make another push at the NBA championship.[85] Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the
                    season began.[86] This caused Bryant to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court
                    earlier in the day and travel to play games later in same day.[87] In the final game of the regular
                    season, the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers. Bryant made two buzzer-beaters to win the game
                    and the Pacific Division title. At the end of the fourth quarter, Bryant made a three-pointer with
                    1.1 seconds left to send it into overtime.[88] The game eventually went to a second overtime, in
                    which Bryant made another three-pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the Blazers,
                    105–104.[88]
